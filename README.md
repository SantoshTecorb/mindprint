# MindPrint

### Problem
- **Privacy Risk**: Sharing knowledge often requires sharing memory files that contain sensitive information
- **Manual Redaction**: Manual removal of PII is tedious and error-prone
- **Knowledge Hoarding**: Without a safe way to share, valuable thinking patterns stay locked away

### Solution
MindPrint automatically:
1. **Redacts PII** - Removes emails, phone numbers, URLs, IP addresses, API keys, and customer IDs
2. **Extracts Patterns** - Identifies core concepts, methodologies, and insights
3. **Formats Knowledge** - Creates structured, shareable cognition files
4. **Preserves Intent** - Maintains the essence of your thinking while removing specifics
